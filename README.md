# TILbot
A simple project to learn about slackbots and interacting with a database in python.

## SQLite
This branch actually adds some database functionality. Any data we pull will be stored in an SQLite database for later retrieval.

Now that TILbot has a memory I can look at how I can interact with it to retrieve data or insights.
